        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY
            SECURITY, CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>

        <p>1.1 Privacy Statement. Dream Soft will treat your personal information in accordance with our
            Privacy
            Statement below.</p>

        <p>By accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of
            the
            Privacy Statement.</p>

        <p>1.2 Password Security. You are responsible to keep your password(s) secure, and you agree not to disclose
            your
            passwords to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs under your user names
            and
            accounts, including any sub-accounts. Dream Soft may request temporary use of your password(s),
            and may
            otherwise retain your password(s) in a secure electronic file related to your account, to facilitate routine
            support
            and maintenance services. If you lose your password(s) or the encryption keys for any of your products or
            Services,
            Dream Soft may not be able to assist you in recovering any associated data or information. You
            must
            notify the Dream Soft immediately of any suspected unauthorized use of your accounts or any
            other
            security breach related to the Services. If Dream Soft determines that a security breach or
            suspected
            fraudulent activity has occurred or is likely to occur on your account, Dream Soft may suspend
            your
            account until the applicable account activity has been verified.</p>

        <p>1.3 Confidential Information. You acknowledge that, in connection with the performance of this Agreement, you
            may
            receive certain Confidential Information of Dream Soft. You hereby agree: (a) to hold and
            maintain in
            strict confidence all Confidential Information and not to disclose it to any third party; and (b) not to use
            any
            Confidential Information of Dream Soft except as permitted by this Agreement or as may be
            necessary to
            exercise rights or perform obligations under this Agreement. ‘Confidential Information’ means, collectively,
            (i) any
            information disclosed by Dream Soft, either directly or indirectly, whether written, verbal,
            magnetic,
            photographic, optical, or other form, or by inspection of tangible objects, which has been, or will be,
            furnished or
            disclosed by a party, or its employees, representatives, consultants or agents, including, without
            limitation,
            algorithms, business plans, customer data, customer lists, customer names, supplier and installer names and
            data,
            designs documents, drawings, engineering information, financial analysis, forecasts, formulas, hardware
            configuration information, know-how, ideas, inventions, market information, marketing plans, processes,
            products,
            product plans, research, specifications, software, source code, trade secrets or any other information which
            is
            designated as ‘confidential,’ ‘proprietary’ or some similar designation, and which has been designated as
            being
            confidential, or which is otherwise disclosed in such a manner or is of such a character as would put a
            reasonable
            person on notice as to the confidential and proprietary nature of the information (collectively, the
            ‘Disclosed
            Materials’); (ii) any information otherwise obtained, directly or indirectly, by a receiving party through
            inspection, review or analysis of the Disclosed Materials; and (iii) information of a third party that is in
            the
            possession of Company and is disclosed to you under this Agreement.</p>

        <p>1.4 Disclosure Under Compulsion of Law. In the event you are the recipient of any court order, subpoena or
            other
            governmental authority which purports to require the disclosure of any of the Dream Soft’
            Confidential
            Information, or in the event such disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange
            rule, you
            shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Dream Soft with prompt notice of the
            same prior
            to any disclosure and with such advance notice so as to afford a reasonable opportunity to protect the
            Confidential
            Information from public disclosure, and shall construe any such court order, subpoena or other governmental
            authority requesting such information in the narrowest permissible manner and shall seek to obtain and
            cooperate
            with Dream Soft to obtain a proper protective order, a court ruling quashing any such subpoena,
            or any
            other governmental or private mechanism for retention of the confidential status of the information
            sought.</p>
