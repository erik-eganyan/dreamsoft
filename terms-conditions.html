            and/or its licensors or other third parties may, at any time, without notice or liability, take actions
            which restrict the use of the Services or other Licensed IP or limit the time of availability of the

            the Company’s network (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion); (b) in order to perform
            maintenance activities, make modifications to the Services or other Licensed IP, and to maintain session

            acknowledge that circumstances outside of the Company’s control (for example, a large scale outbreak of a
            new computer virus), scheduling conflicts and/or other unforeseen circumstances may cause significant delays
            in the Company’s ability to schedule a Service session and/or to otherwise attend a scheduled Service
            session. In the event that such circumstances cause the Company to miss a scheduled Service Session, the

        <h5><b>11. LICENSE TO ACCESS SOFTWARE AND THIRD PARTY SERVICES</b></h5>

        <p>11.1 Licensed IP. The Services (and all copyright and other proprietary or intellectual property rights),
            all software, CDs, programs, documentation and other intellectual property which is owned by the Company
            and/or which the Company makes available or furnishes to you pursuant to this Agreement, via download, other
            media, or other delivery method, and/or in connection with the provision of the Services, and all other
            rights and derivative works related thereto are referred to as the ‘Licensed IP.’ The Licensed IP may be
            accompanied by an end-user access license agreement or similar agreement from the Company. Your use of the
            Licensed IP is governed by the terms of such agreement and by this Agreement, where applicable. You may not
            install or use any Licensed IP that is accompanied by or includes an end-user access license agreement
            unless you first agree to the terms and conditions of the end-user access license agreement. With regard to
            any Licensed IP for which your acceptance of a separate license agreement is not required, the Company
            hereby grants to you one limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to access and
            use the same, only during the term of this Agreement, solely for your own personal or internal business
            purposes with respect to the Computer Systems and Devices specifically registered with or otherwise
            authorized by the Company for use in connection with the Services subject to this Agreement, and only as
            part of or for use with the Services and for no other purpose. You agree not to copy, modify, publish,
            transmit, rent, license, re-sell, sublicense, transfer, trade, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
            attempt to derive source code or other intellectual property from the Company or allow others to use or
            benefit from any of the Licensed IP. You acknowledge and agree that you are not granted any title or rights
            of ownership in any of the Licensed IP. The Company reserves the right to update or change the Licensed IP
            from time to time and you agree to cooperate in performing such steps as may be necessary to install any
            updates or upgrades to the Licensed IP. All rights not expressly granted to you are expressly reserved by
            the Company and any Third Party Providers, licensors, and suppliers, as applicable. All software included
            within the Licensed IP is either a commercial product, produced entirely at private expense, copyrighted and
            owned by the Company or a third party provider or supplier, licensed to the Company or is otherwise
            proprietary to the Company.</p>

        <p>11.2 Licensed IP Confidentiality and Ownership. You agree that the Licensed IP is confidential information
            of the Company or its Third Party Providers, licensors, or suppliers, and that you will not disclose the
            Licensed IP or any other confidential information of the Company to others or use the Licensed IP or any
            other confidential information except as expressly permitted herein. The Licensed IP contains copyrighted
            material, trade secrets, patents, and proprietary information owned by the Company or its Third Party
            Providers, licensors, or suppliers. You agree not to remove or alter any trademark, trade name, copyright or
            other proprietary notices, legends, symbols, or labels appearing on or in copies of any of the Licensed IP.
            You acknowledge that the license is not a sale of intellectual property and that the Company or its Third
            Party Providers, licensors, or suppliers will continue to own all right, title and interest, including but
            not limited to all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and moral rights, to the Licensed IP and
            related documentation, as well as any corrections, updates and upgrades.</p>

        <p>11.3 Third Party Software. As part of the Services, the Company may sublicense to you or suggest the
            acquisition, installation and use of certain Licensed IP that is third party software (the ‘Third Party
            Software’). You acknowledge that any Third Party Software will be sublicensed to you by the Company or
            licensed to you by the Third Party Provider that is the owner or licensee of the Third Party Software. You
            agree to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions set forth by such Third Party Providers before
            installing Third Party Software, regardless of whether the Company sublicenses to you or assists you in the
            acquisition, installation, and/or use of Third Party Software. The Company has no rights to the Third Party
            Software and does not license Third Party Software to you except to the extent that the Company is a
            reseller or licensee of the Third Party Software. The Company does not make any representation or warranty
            regarding the Third Party Software.</p>

        <p>11.4 Assistance and Support. The Company will provide technical assistance and support for the Licensed IP
            in accordance with its then current policies. To the extent that the Company provides technical assistance
            and support for any Third Party Software or equipment, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions
            under which you licensed such Third Party Software or purchased such equipment. The Company makes no
            representation or warranty that it is an authorized service provider for any Third Party Software or for any
            equipment, and you acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to determine if you require
            additional rights for the Company to provide such support and, if so, to acquire such rights.</p>

        <h5><b>12. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR</b></h5>

        <p>You acknowledge that the Company is an independent contractor and neither the Company nor any of its
            directors, officers, agents, employees, or affiliates is or shall be deemed employed by you. The Company

            Company and its directors, officers, agents, employees, and affiliates are not required to perform the
            Services for you during any particular hour of the day or night, and the time spent on providing service is
            at the Company’s discretion, subject to your access times and security requirements. You further acknowledge
            that the Company is not required to devote its full time or the full time of any of its directors, officers,
            agents, employees, or affiliates to the performance of the Services, and you acknowledge that the Company
            has other clients and that it offers Services to the general public. The order and sequence in which the
            Services are to be performed shall be under the control of the Company and its agents, employees and
            affiliates.</p>

        <h5><b>13. LIMITATIONS AND RISKS</b></h5>

        <p>13.1 Limitations of Liability. In no event shall the company or its agents, employees, affiliates, directors
            or officers or any third party providers, licensors or suppliers have any liability to you or any other
            third party, and you agree to release and hold the company and its agents, employees, affiliates, directors
            and officers and any third party providers, licensors and suppliers harmless from, any liability arising
            from (a) any delays in the performance of the services; (b) any third party software; (c) the performance of
            the services, except and only to the extent that the company is grossly negligent in performing the
            services; or (d) consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages even if advised in
            advance of the possibility of such damages. You acknowledge that the company has set its fees and entered
            into this agreement in reliance upon limitations of liability and the disclaimers of warranties and damages
            set forth in this agreement and that these provisions form an essential basis of the bargain between the
            parties. The parties agree that the limitations of liability and disclaimers specified in this agreement
            will survive and apply even if portions of this agreement are found to have failed in their essential
            purpose.</p>

        <p>13.2 Risk of Loss. You agree that your use of the Services is your sole responsibility and is solely at your
            own risk. You acknowledge and agree that the Internet, over which many of the Services are delivered, is not
            owned, operated or managed by, or in any way affiliated with the Company, and you agree that the Company is
            not responsible for and has no control over the information, content or other materials, which may be
            accessed on the Internet through use of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that the Internet is not a
            secure network and that third parties may be able to intercept, access, use, or corrupt the information that
            you transmit or receive over the Internet, whether in connection with the Company’s provision of the
            Services or otherwise. The Company is not responsible for invalid destinations, transmission errors, or
            corruption or security of your data. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company does not own or
            control all of the various facilities and communications lines through which Services may be provided and
            that the Company does not guarantee access to or through websites, servers or other facilities on or
            connected to the Internet, whether or not such websites, servers or facilities are owned or controlled by
            the Company. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to take proper and adequate measures to
            preserve, protect and safeguard critical data by backing up such data in appropriate ways prior to any
            Services being performed by the Company.</p>

        <h5><b>14. WARRANTY LIMITATIONS</b></h5>

        <p>The services (including, without limitation, any third party software) are provided on an ‘as is’ basis, and
            your use of the services (including, without limitation, any third party software) is at your own risk. The
            company does not make any representation or warranty regarding the use or the results of the use of the
            services (including, without limitation, any third party software) in terms of accuracy, reliability,
            satisfaction or otherwise. You assume sole responsibility for your use of the services (including, without
            limitation, any third party software) to achieve your intended results. The company does not make any
            representation or warranty with respect to the line rate, access or availability of the services (including,
            without limitation, any third party software). Without in any way limiting section 14 of this agreement, you
            specifically agree that the company, its affiliates, directors, stockholders, officers, agents and
            employees, and the company’s suppliers, resellers, partners and their respective affiliates, will not be
            liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, consequential or exemplary damages of any
            kind and/or arising under any legal theory, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits,
            goodwill, use, data, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or other intangible losses (even
            if any of the foregoing parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from the
            use or inability to use the company’s products or services (including, without limitation, any third party
            software) or in any way relating to the company’s products or services (including, without limitation, any
            third party software).</p>

        <h5><b>15. COMPLETE CONTRACT</b></h5>

        <p>This Agreement (including any other documents incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire
            agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and integrates all prior
            understandings and agreements between the parties with respect thereto, whether oral or written. You agree
            to accept the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement to the exclusion of any standard terms you
            may customarily have for the purchase of services. No other agreement, representations, warranties or other
            matters, oral or written, purportedly agreed to or represented by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
            agents, employees and affiliates, or contained in any sales materials or brochures, shall be deemed to bind
            the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. You acknowledge that you are
            entering into this Agreement based solely on the basis of the terms contained herein.</p>

        <h5><b>16. INDEMNIFICATION; INFRINGEMENT REMEDY</b></h5>

        <p>16.1 Indemnification Obligations. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
            directors, stockholders, officers, agents and employees from and against all liabilities, costs and
            expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, related to or arising from: (a) your violation of any
            applicable laws or regulations, this Agreement, the Privacy Statement or the terms of any agreement
            governing your use of Third Party Software (or any of the foregoing by parties who use your account, with or
            without your permission, to access the Service); (b) the use of the Services or the Internet or the
            placement or transmission of any message, information, software or other materials on the Internet by you
            (or any parties who use your account, with or without your permission, to access the Services); (c) acts,
            errors, or omissions by you (or any parties who use your account, with or without your permission, to access
            the Services); (d) any and all claims for damage or injury to persons or property or for loss of life or
            limb whereby you have been found liable to any third party under any product liability, tort liability or
            similar action that may in any way arise out of or result from or in connection with this Agreement, except
            to the extent that such liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company; or
            (e) claims for infringement of any intellectual property rights arising from the use of the Services, Third
            Party Software, the Content, or the Internet, except with respect to the Licensed IP, subject to Section
            16.2 below.</p>

        <p>16.2 Infringement Remedy. In the event that any portion of the Licensed IP is, in the Company’s sole
            opinion, likely to or does become the subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual property rights
            arising from the use of the Services, the Company may, at its option and expense, procure for you the right
            to continue using the Services or modify the Services to make them non-infringing. If, in the Company’s sole
            opinion, neither of the foregoing options is reasonably available to the Company, then the Company may (a)
            terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to you, and in no event shall such termination be
            considered a breach of this Agreement; and (b) in its sole discretion, elect to issue you a refund for all
            or a portion of the Services provided.</p>

        <h5><b>17. TAXES</b></h5>

        <p>Any and all taxes, except income taxes of the Company, imposed or assessed by reason of this Agreement or
            its performance, including, but not limited to, sales or use taxes, shall be paid by you.</p>

        <h5><b>18. ASSIGNMENT</b></h5>

        <p>You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement without the Company’s prior written
            consent. Subject to this limitation, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
            heirs, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto.</p>

        <h5><b>19. FORCE MAJEURE</b></h5>

        <p>The Company shall be excused for the period of any delay in the performance of any of its obligations under
            this Agreement when the same is due (in whole or in part) to a cause reasonably beyond the Company’s
            control, including, without limitation, labor disputes, traffic congestion, delivery failures, product
            shortages, civil commotion, war, governmental regulations or controls, government action, fire or other
            casualty, weather, and/or acts of God.</p>

        <h5><b>20. WAIVER</b></h5>

        <p>The waiver by either party of a breach or a default by the other party shall not be construed as a waiver of
            any succeeding breach, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail
            itself of any right, power or privilege operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege by such party.
            No waiver, consent, modification, alteration, addition, or change of terms of this Agreement shall bind
            either party unless in writing and signed by an authorized signatory of the party against whom enforcement
            is sought, and then such waiver, consent, modification or change shall be effective only in the specific
            instance and for the specific purpose given. The Company shall not be required to give notice to you to
            enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement.</p>

        <h5><b>21. SEVERABILITY</b></h5>

        <p>If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
            jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not render the entire Agreement invalid and all
            remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such event, (a) the
            Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the particular invalid or unenforceable provision, and the
            rights and obligations of each party shall be construed and enforced accordingly or (b) to the extent the
            scope of any provision is too broad in any respect to permit enforcement, the parties hereto agree that such
            scope may be judicially modified accordingly.</p>

        <h5><b>22. NOTICES</b></h5>

        <p>Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notice to the Company shall be given by email to:
            support@itdreamsoft.com. Any notice to you shall be sent to the email address that you provide to the
            Company during the registration process. Notice shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after an email
            is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the email address is invalid.</p>

        <h5><b>23. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY</b></h5>

        <p>Each Third Party Provider is a third-party beneficiary of your representations, warranties, and covenants in
            this Agreement; and each Third Party Provider has all the rights and benefits of the Company under, and the
            ability to enforce, this Agreement. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, this
            Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than
            you and the Company.</p>
